## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Script not found" error**

   - Make sure you copied the correct script ID
   - Verify the deployment was successful

2. **"Access denied" error**

   - Check that the web app is set to "Anyone" access
   - Re-authorize the app if needed

3. **Data not appearing in sheets**

   - Check the Apps Script logs for errors
   - Verify the spreadsheet ID is correct
   - Make sure you have edit permissions on the spreadsheet

4. **CORS errors**
   - The current setup uses `mode: 'no-cors'` to handle CORS
   - If you still get errors, you may need to use a different approach

## üîí Security Notes

- The web app is set to "Anyone" access, which means anyone can submit forms
- Consider adding CAPTCHA or rate limiting for production use
- The script ID is visible in your code, so keep your Google account secure

## üì± Form Types

Your portfolio now has 4 different form types:

1. **General Inquiry** - Basic contact form
2. **Project Consultant** - For project consultation requests
3. **Project Maintenance** - For existing project maintenance
4. **Hourly Rate** - For hourly work inquiries

Each form will be clearly labeled in the Google Sheets with the appropriate service type.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Test all form types
2. Customize the form fields if needed
3. Set up email notifications (optional)
4. Add data validation rules in Google Sheets
5. Create automated responses (optional)

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Google Apps Script logs
2. Verify all URLs and IDs are correct
3. Test with a simple form submission first
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
